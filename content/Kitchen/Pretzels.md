I use [Gaby Dalkin's recipe](https://whatsgabycooking.com/parmesan-pretzel-knots/) with a few adjustments. They are super easy to make if you have a stand mixer with a dough hook, but it's not needed. 

Expect 1 hour of dough rising time, so they'll take 1.5 - 1.75 hours total to make.

## Ingredients
**Dough**
- 1.5 cups warm water
- 1 tablespoon sugar
- 1 package active dry yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)
- 4.5 cups all-purpose flour
- 2 teaspoons salt
- 4 tablespoons butter, melted

**To cook**
- Parchment paper or vegetable oil for baking sheets
- 10 cups water
- ⅔ cup baking soda
- 1 egg yolk beaten with 1 tablespoon water
- Some type of coarse salt

## Procedure
1. In a bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and active dry yeast. Let it sit for a few minutes until it foams.
2. Add the flour, salt, and melted butter. Form a dough and knead it until smooth (either by hand or with the dough hook).
3. Let the dough rest, covered, in a well-oiled bowl (you can use the same bowl from step 1!) until it doubles in size (approximately 1 hour).
4. Preheat the oven to 450°F (230°C).

5. Bring the 10 cups of water with the baking soda to a boil in a large pot. 
6. Prepare the baking sheets with parchment paper or just oil them.
7. Meanwhile, cut the risen dough into equal pieces. Roll them into small cylinders and form the pretzels (knot-shaped pretzels are awesome too). 
8. Using a large spatula, place the pretzels into the boiling water for less than a minute.
9. Once each pretzel has gone through the baking soda bath, place them on the baking sheets. Brush the tops with beaten yolk + water mixture and sprinkle with salt.
10. Bake them for a maximum of 15 minutes.
