This is one of my favorite types of alfajores (ever), and they are pretty easy to make. They are super rich but taste amazing.
My tweaks to the recipe: a reduction in the amount of butter and the amount of dulce de leche, adding a little bit of lemon zest to the dough, and making them much smaller than she recommends. So here is the recipe, translated and with my recommendations:

## Ingredients
- 200 gr of softened butter
- 100 gr of sugar
- 1 egg
- Zest of half a lemon
- 300 gr of all-purpose flour (+ some extra for rolling the dough)
- Dulce de Leche (a lot, plan for a minimum of 350 gr)
- Powdered sugar for the topping (optional)

## Procedure
- Make a dough with the butter (at room temp), sugar, egg, lemon zest, and flour. It's a hard dough, but try not to knead it or touch it too much, just what's necessary for it to form. Let it rest covered in the fridge for at least 20'.
- Roll the dough very thinly on a counter with some flour. Cut the "cookie of the alfajor", place them on a baking sheet, and bake at 420°F for 8-10'
- Fill them up with dulce de leche once they are completely cool. Be gentle because they crack easily. You'll get 34 alfajores if you roll the dough thin and cut the cookies small.</li>
