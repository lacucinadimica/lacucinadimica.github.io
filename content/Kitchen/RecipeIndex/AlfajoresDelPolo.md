These are one of my favorite types of alfajores (ever), and they are pretty easy to make. They are super rich, but taste amazing and will win anyone over.
My tweaks to the recipe: a reduction in the amount of butter and the amount of dulce de leche, adding a little bit of lemon zest to the dough, and I like making them much smaller than she recommends. So here is the recipe, translated and with my recommendations:

## Ingredients
- 300 gr of all-purpose flour (+ some extra for rolling the dough)
- 200 gr of butter
- 100 gr of sugar
- 1 egg
- Zest of half a lemon
- Dulce de Leche (a lot, plan for a minimum of 350 gr)
- Powdered Sugar for the topping (optional)

## Procedure
- Make a dough with the flour, butter (at room temp), egg, sugar, and lemon zest. It's a hard dough, but try not to knead it or touch it too much, just what's necessary for it to form. Let it rest covered in the fridge for at least 20. I usually use plastic wrap.
- Roll the dough very thinly on a counter with some flour. Cut the "cookie of the alfajor" and take to a 420F oven for 8-10'.
- Fill them up with dulce de leche once they are completely cool. Be gentle because they crack easily. You'll get 34 alfajores if you roll the dough thin and cut the cookies small.</li>
